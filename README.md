# hydration-bot
A discord bot that allows you and your friends to remind each other to hydrate and drink water! Especially useful for those who forget to drink water often.

This bot can send reminders to hydrate and drink water several different ways:
  1) Send it to everyone in the server (#remind everyone)
  2) Send it to specific people in the server and pinging them in the process (#remind _user's id_) <-- ex. #remind @testUser
  3) Poll function. You can poll your friends if they have hydrated lately or not (and keep them accountable)!
  
Some commands I am working on/planning on creating:
  1) Send reminders to specific roles, and not just specific users.
  2) Allow users to schedule a hydration reminder for themselves or a friend.
  3) Daily hydration game (who can drink the most glasses of liquids per day? Soup does not count, unfortunately.).
  4) Providing resources on the importance of hydrating often and the consequences if you don't.
